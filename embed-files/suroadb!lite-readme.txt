SuroADB Lite 2.6

platform-tools version:
platform-tools_r30.0.3-windows
=============================================================
ABOUT

SuroADB Lite is a reworked user-intuitive version of it's predecessor, SuroADB.

SuroADB is a simple ADB command interface with various features for easy and
reliable adb command execution. It features auto-restore scripts, error handling,
an easy-to-read user interface, several settings, and more technical code that
slightly improves performance and experience.

The Lite version lacks added error handling features and does not have
auto-restoring capabilities, but future versions will slowly add the feature set of SuroADB.


ADB is not made by Kutsuro (Matt) and is present for the purpose of functionality
for SuroADB. The adb windows zip (platform-tools)  is not  modified and is
taken straight from the android developer sdk.


Note: Please do not re-release the raw SuroADB script and claim it as your own creation.
          If  you're  going to  modify  and/or  add  new  features,  please  provide credit to the
          original author (me). It is not required, but i'll really appreciate it. =D
